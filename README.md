# Burger-Logger

The NodeJS-Handlebars app that takes an input for a burger you want to eat and lists it in a menu! If you want to eat it, just click "devour" and it'll be eaten.

## What it does

This app focuses on the use of MySQL database, Express, Handlebars, JavaScript and ORMs. Burger-Logger runs off of a local server with npm packages. The code consists of multiple files to organize different actions of get, post, and put to handle the data that is being passed through from the user input and button interactions.

### Languages/Libraries Used
* JavaScript
* MySQL
* BootStrap
* jQuery
* Handlebars
* Express
* ORMs (object-relational mapping)

### Notable Credits
The code for this program was heavily influenced by in-class activities as a base. Also, **huge** appreciation for a great classmate, Karen and her wonderful husband. They took the time to help me debug an extensive issue over the course of several hours late at night, which I will forever be grateful for!
